# Article Detail Modal Redesign Summary

## Overview
Redesigned the article detail modal with a **two-mode interface**: starts as a compact popup window showing article content immediately, with an expand button to access the full magazine-style layout with integrated AI analysis.

## Key Changes

- Compact typography and spacing
- AI loads in background with subtle indicator
- Shows AI summary when ready with "Expand" button

**Expanded Mode:**
- Full-screen magazine layout
- Large hero image (60vh height)
- Two-column grid (2/3 article + 1/3 AI sidebar)
- Large typography (prose-lg)
- Complete AI analysis in sticky sidebar
- Generous spacing and padding

### 2. **Instant Full Article Loading** ðŸ†•
