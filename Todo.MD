# Features to add
I would like to add sql backend for this so that I don't have to load the articles each time I start up the website. It should also track the date of the article and make sure not to add dupicalates as well which should be easy.

# Add the feature so that when you like on one of the tabs like games or business it truly changes what new articles show up.


# Source debugging
Add a feature to see if the images are getting parse and to give out each source as a json that can be view and debugged in the source page.

Add a search bar.

Sort sources by working not working and other errors in the main source page.

# Styling

The font like the main main header one should be like garamond or some seirf then it should use geisit for the most of the other fonts.
