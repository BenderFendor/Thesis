# Features to add
I would like to add sql backend for this so that I don't have to load the articles each time I start up the website. It should also track the date of the article and make sure not to add dupicalates as well which should be easy.

# Add the feature so that when you like on one of the tabs like games or business it truly changes what new articles show up.


# Source debugging
http://localhost:3000/sources/972mag.com/debug

Fix the debug page is right now is it not working at all it if you can the docker compose to say backend:8001 instead of localhost:8001 that works but it breaks the rest of the website so it needs to be something else to fix it.


# Styling

The font like the main main header one should be like garamond or some seirf then it should use geisit for the most of the other fonts.

# Add a logger feature
So it like turns the debug print logs off or on
