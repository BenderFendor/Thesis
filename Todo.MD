# Features to add
I would like to add sql backend for this so that I don't have to load the articles each time I start up the website. It should also track the date of the article and make sure not to add dupicalates as well which should be easy.

# Add the feature so that when you like on one of the tabs like games or business it truly changes what new articles show up.


# Source debugging
Also update the source page to work with the new backend and add a like toggle for debugging mode and user mode and have it so that you can debug mode has all the console.log prints and all those debugging like meals then those are removed when your in user mode so the end user doesn't have hella things on the screen

# Styling
The font like the main main header one should be like garamond or some seirf then it should use geisit for the most of the other fonts.
Also there is no hover animation or color for any of the button on this page and the backgroudns and secondy backgruonds are the same color I like the dark black but there should be a lighter black for the other panels like 20% lighter

# Image source debugging
For this Im thinking we have to add like errors for parsing but what type of error. Like image found but not parsedable by frontend. No images in the json/source at all. Images founded and we can use them but it still doesn't any us to display them idk why?

# The stream vs static source.
I don't really understand why that exist it really show be the same thing and just two parts of it right now it is coded like two different features instead of one fused backend feature for getting sources.

# Add a logger feature
So it like turns the debug print logs off or on

# RSS and Image Parsing
I need a more robust image parsing and also some that can get the images and load them when they are http or https
