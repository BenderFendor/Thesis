# UX Patterns Reference

## Compact hero pattern
- Title: 2 to 3 lines max
- Summary: 2 to 3 lines max
- Actions: 2 to 3 primary actions in a single row
- Metrics: show 3 to 4 key numbers in small cards

## Sidebar compression
- Use a single summary card for narrative text.
- Move secondary blocks into stacked cards with short labels.
- Convert long "contact" sections into action rows.

## View mode clarity
- Provide a view header with:
  - Current view name
  - Active filters
  - Counts (articles, sources, regions)

## Selection-to-results flow
- Selected state: name + count + reset control
- Sources list: top 5 to 8 sources
- Articles list: top 8 to 12 articles

## Research workspace layout
- Left column: brief, answer, structured summary
- Right column: reasoning steps, related sources, recent queries
- Optional Flow mode: render reasoning steps as a timeline

## No-emoji rule
- Replace emoji with icons or text labels.
- Prefer dots, chips, and badges for status indication.
- Remove emoji from logs, docs, and UI copy.
