- **Note**: Ready for article link functionality when API returns article IDs

## Technical Improvements

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "react-markdown": "^9.x.x",
  "remark-gfm": "^4.x.x"
}
```

### CSS Variables Used
- `--news-bg-primary`: Main background
- `--news-bg-secondary`: Card backgrounds
- `--border`: Border colors
- `--ring`: Accent borders
- `--primary`: Primary action color (emerald)
- `--muted-foreground`: Secondary text
- `--foreground`: Primary text
- `--card`: Card backgrounds
- `--muted`: Muted backgrounds

### Component Structure
```
<div> (main container)
  <header> (fixed, matches main page)
  <main> (content area)
    - Page header with back link
    - Search form
    - Sample queries
    - Loading state
    - Results:
      - Stats
      - Thinking steps (cleaner display)
      - Final answer (markdown rendered)
      - Action buttons
    - Info card
  </main>
  <ArticleDetailModal /> (for future article links)
</div>
```

## Thinking Steps Parser
The key improvement in the thinking steps display is the custom parser that extracts structured information from raw LLM output:

```typescript
// Before: Raw text like "tool: analyze_source_coverage\nInput: {\"topic\": \"technology\"}"
// After: Clean display:
//   "Using tool: analyze_source_coverage"
//   "Input: {\"topic\": \"technology\"}"
```

This eliminates the "JSON debuggy" appearance while maintaining all information.

## Future Enhancements (TODO)

### Article Link Functionality üöß
To enable clickable article links in the markdown response:

1. **API Enhancement Required**:
   - Modify `performNewsResearch` to return article IDs/URLs used in the response
   - Add article metadata to the response

2. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - Create a custom markdown component for article links
   - Parse article references from markdown
   - Make links clickable to open ArticleDetailModal
   - Example: `[Article Title](article://123)` opens article with ID 123

3. **Suggested Approach**:
   ```typescript
   // Custom link renderer for ReactMarkdown
   const components = {
     a: ({ href, children }: any) => {
       if (href.startsWith('article://')) {
         const articleId = href.replace('article://', '')
         return (
           <button
             onClick={() => handleArticleClick(articleId)}
             className="text-primary hover:underline"
           >
             {children}
           </button>
         )
       }
       return <a href={href} target="_blank" rel="noopener">{children}</a>
     }
   }
   ```

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Header navigation works
- [x] Search form submits correctly
- [x] Sample queries populate the search
- [x] Loading state displays during search
- [x] Thinking steps display cleanly (no JSON)
- [x] Markdown renders properly
- [x] Action buttons work (New Research, Show/Hide Reasoning)
- [x] Responsive design maintained
- [ ] Article links open modal (pending API enhancement)

## Screenshot Comparisons

### Before
- Basic Card-based layout

- White/generic styling

### After
- Modern dark theme
- Clean, structured thinking steps
- Markdown-rendered answers

## Summary
The search page has been completely redesigned to match the main website's aesthetic while adding significant improvements to the thinking steps display (eliminating JSON clutter) and markdown rendering for better formatted responses. The foundation for article link functionality is in place and ready for backend integration.
