# News Research Agent - Complete Integration

## üéØ Overview

The News Research Agent is an AI-powered research assistant specifically designed for your news aggregation platform. Unlike generic search, it:

- **Searches YOUR articles** - Analyzes the news articles in your database
- **Shows chain-of-thought** - Displays the agent's reasoning process transparently
- **Compares sources** - Analyzes how different outlets cover topics
- **Identifies bias** - Helps users understand diverse perspectives
- **Integrates seamlessly** - Matches your news platform's design and theme

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. Article Database Search
- Searches through all cached articles in the platform
- Analyzes titles, descriptions, sources, and categories
- Returns relevant articles with context

### 2. Source Coverage Analysis  
- Compares how different news sources cover topics
- Identifies which sources are reporting on specific events
- Helps users understand media landscape

### 3. Transparent Reasoning (Chain-of-Thought)
- Shows exactly what the agent is doing
- Displays tool calls and their results
- Includes timestamps for each step
- Visual indicators for different step types:
  - **Action** (blue sparkles) - Agent decides to use a tool
  - **Tool Start** (yellow spinner) - Tool execution begins
  - **Observation** (green check) - Tool returns results
  - **Answer** (emerald newspaper) - Final response

### 4. Web Search Fallback
- Uses DuckDuckGo when information isn't in articles

    2. Use analyze_source_coverage for comparisons
    3. Only use web_search for background info
    ...
    """)
])

# Model settings (lines ~208-212)
llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(

## üîç Technical Details

### Custom Tools

#### 1. search_news_articles(query: str)
```python
@tool
def search_news_articles(query: str) -> str:
    """Search through platform's article database"""
    # Searches titles, descriptions, sources, categories
    # Returns formatted list of top 10 matches
    # Sorted by publish date (newest first)
```

#### 2. analyze_source_coverage(topic: str)
```python
@tool
def analyze_source_coverage(topic: str) -> str:
    """Analyze how sources cover a topic"""
    # Groups articles by source
    # Counts coverage per source
    # Shows example headlines
    # Identifies coverage patterns
```

#### 3. get_web_search_results(query: str)
```python
@tool
def get_web_search_results(query: str) -> str:
    """Fallback web search via DuckDuckGo"""
    # Used only when articles don't have info
    # Provides context and background
    # Agent decides when to use this
```

### Chain-of-Thought Capture

```python
class StreamingThoughtHandler(BaseCallbackHandler):
    """Captures agent reasoning in real-time"""
    
    def on_agent_action(self, action, **kwargs):
        # Record tool decisions
        
    def on_tool_start(self, serialized, input_str, **kwargs):
        # Record tool execution start
        
    def on_tool_end(self, output, **kwargs):
        # Record tool results
        
    def on_agent_finish(self, finish, **kwargs):
        # Record final answer
```

## üìà Performance

### Response Times
- **Article search**: 1-3 seconds
- **Source analysis**: 2-4 seconds
- **With web search**: 5-10 seconds
- **Total (with thinking)**: 3-12 seconds

### Scalability
- Searches through entire article cache (hundreds to thousands)
- Efficient dictionary lookups
- No database queries (uses in-memory cache)
- Scales with article count

### Rate Limiting
- Gemini API: Free tier limits apply
- DuckDuckGo: No hard limits
- Consider caching frequent queries

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "No articles available in database"**
- News cache may be empty
- Backend still loading articles
- Check `/cache/status` endpoint

**2. Empty thinking steps**
- Set `include_thinking: true` in request
- Check `StreamingThoughtHandler` initialization
- Verify `verbose=True` in agent executor

**3. Slow responses**
- Normal for first query (cold start)
- Large article sets take longer
- Consider reducing `max_iterations` (default: 5)

**4. Agent not using article search**
- Check system prompt instructions
- Verify `search_news_articles` is first in tools list
- Review agent's reasoning in thinking steps
