be viewed as an infinite array of aromatic molecules. For a finite array, some of those carbon atoms will be bound to hydrogen atoms, resulting in an aromatic hydrocarbon instead. Credit : AlexanderAIUS/Core-Materials/flickr The name polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon might sound complicated, but it‚Äôs relatively straightforward. Hydrogen is the most common and abundant element in the Universe, and carbon is the first heavy element you make once stars first begin to form. While hydrogen and helium persist as the two most common species of atom to exist in the Universe, carbon is pretty common too, coming in at number four, with only oxygen reaching a greater abundance in the number three spot. When carbon and hydrogen atoms bind together, in any configuration, to make a molecule, that molecule is known as a hydrocarbon. There are plenty of molecules that exist, chemically, that are composed of carbon and hydrogen in ringed configurations ‚Äî such as benzene ‚Äî where the various carbon atoms are linked together in rings of six carbon atoms apiece; the geometry of carbon bonding supports these bond angles as a more stable configuration over configurations with either greater or fewer numbers of carbon atoms. Wherever the ringed configuration exists, we call that an aromatic molecule. So that explains the ‚Äúaromatic hydrocarbon‚Äù part, and then instead of single-ringed molecules, many aromatic species actually have multiple ‚Äúcarbon ring‚Äù configurations linked up together. That‚Äôs what makes a molecule polycyclic, and hence that‚Äôs what a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is. Whereas ‚Äúheated dust‚Äù emits across a wide variety of infrared wavelengths, in a temperature-dependent fashion, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are excited by a few specific wavelengths: at 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 microns. This four-panel image is specifically focused on wavelengths of 3.3 microns, 7.7 microns, and 11.3 microns: wavelengths at which polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules exhibit the strongest emission signatures when heated by an external source. Credit : E.J. Tarantino et al., arXiv:2512.04060, 2025 Whereas, above, the regions that appear in the 15 micron window (panel D) correspond to general thermal emission, the regions that are also excessively bright in those three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon wavelength windows correspond not only to those molecules, but to a substantial density of those molecules in a region where they‚Äôre being heated ‚Äî and thus, from a molecule‚Äôs point of view, excited into a state where they can copiously emit energy ‚Äî by an external source. Now, even at ‚Äújust‚Äù a distance of 4.6 million light-years away, none of the telescopes we have in our arsenal are capable of resolving what that external source is, but we have a comprehensive enough knowledge of astrophysics to know what‚Äôs going on: these are young protostars, or clumps of matter in the process of giving birth to new stars, that are heating up and exciting the molecules that are present surrounding them. We see these up close here in our own Milky Way, often in great detail, but when we see them from far away, all they look like is small, shielded clumps of glowing dust that appear bright at these three specific wavelengths: 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 microns. So even though this galaxy is an extremely low-metallicity galaxy, with only about 3% of the amount of heavy elements (oxygen, carbon, neon, iron, etc.) found in our Solar System, we can be certain that it has plenty of dust inside of it. That‚Äôs big news. But these protostars, or young stellar objects (YSOs) as they‚Äôre sometimes called, aren‚Äôt sites of dust production, they‚Äôre just the sites where you can observe the dust‚Äôs presence. So where is it getting created? The dying red giant star, R Sculptoris, exhibits a very unusual set of ejecta when viewed in millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths: revealing a spiral structure. This is thought to be due to the presence of a binary companion: something our own Sun lacks but that approximately half of the stars in the universe possess. Stars lose approximately half of their mass ‚Äî some more, and some less ‚Äî as they evolve through the red giant and AGB phases and into an eventual planetary nebula/white dwarf combination. Credit : ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO)/M. Maercker et al. Again, we know the answer from looking nearby: a very large producer of cosmic dust are stars like R Sculptoris, shown above, which is known as an AGB star, or a star on the asymptotic giant branch of stellar evolution. During this phase ‚Äî one of the final phases in the lives of all but the absolutely most massive stars ‚Äî an extraordinarily large amount of dust can be produced. In fact, for every ‚Äúsolar mass‚Äù worth of stars that enters the AGB phase, a few percent of that mass can be converted into dust, which is a remarkably significant amount of dust by any metric. While the aforementioned young stellar objects may be glowing copiously with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules, they aren‚Äôt the sites from which the dust was produced; they‚Äôre merely the locations from which the dust can be detected from its characteristic glow, proving it ubiquitously exists. But separately, independent of those glowing protostars, we can not only identify and look at where the AGB stars within Sextans A are, we can also take a spectrum of those AGB stars, and determine what the properties and composition of the dust are that is actively being produced by those AGB stars within Sextans A. AGB stars have existed all throughout cosmic history, and are expected to have played a major role in cosmic dust production for as long as stars have existed. What‚Äôs fascinating, however, is that the total fraction of heavy elements that exist within the AGB star itself lead to a relationship between what the specific element ratios of the dust that it produces turns out to be. In particular, a low fraction of heavy elements leads to iron-rich but silicon-poor dust production, while greater fractions would lead to a significant silicon presence as well, as a recent companion study has demonstrated . This graph shows a spectrum of an Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star in the Sextans A galaxy. It compares data collected by NASA‚Äôs James Webb Space Telescope with models of mostly silicate-free dust and dust containing at least 5% silicates. Note that a silicon-free spectrum and a spectrum that includes silicon at the 0.8% abundance level cannot be distinguished by the current data, but a 5% silicon contribution can be ruled out. Credit : NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Joseph Olmsted (STScI) This is remarkable, because here in the modern Milky Way, a mix of three key ingredients are required to make dust: carbon, silicon, and iron. But back in the early Universe, not all of those ingredients were abundant, and so it was a bit puzzling as to whether dust could be produced at all by the conventionally understood mechanisms. The Sextans A observations, definitively, put any doubts to rest: even with barely any silicon at all, dust is still getting generated, even if AGB stars are hardly producing any silicon at all. It‚Äôs like learning you can bake a cake without flour, and that under the right conditions, simply using butter and sugar will do. While today‚Äôs dust that we observe up close might be predominantly composed of silicate grains, dust in the early Universe, although different from today‚Äôs dust, can still be brought into existence. With the power of JWST and a mix of complex theoretical modeling and clever observational techniques, we‚Äôve just revealed how it happens in Sextans A, which lacks much of the evolved property that our own Milky Way possesses, but which closely mirrors what should have happened early on in cosmic history: back when we‚Äôre seeing the dusty JWST galaxies that have relatively small fractions of heavy elements within them. At long last, after decades of wondering how the most distant galaxies of all could possibly produce dust at such early times, we‚Äôve finally learned that ‚Äútoo much, too soon,‚Äù is the wrong question to be asking. Apparently, the recipe our own galaxy uses wasn‚Äôt the recipe the Universe followed back in its more pristine past! This article Cosmic dust: ‚Äútoo much, too soon‚Äù no longer! is featured on Big Think .     —R     Cosmic dust: ‚Äútoo much, too soon‚Äù no longer!

One of the most fascinating things about the Universe is that whenever we look at it in a novel way ‚Äî in new wavelengths of light, with greater resolution, or with superior sensitivity ‚Äî we give ourselves the opportunity to be surprised. Instead of merely finding fainter or more distant versions of what we had already established was out there, we often find things that we didn‚Äôt even know we ought to be looking for previously. They might include new classes or populations of astronomical objects, an unexpected abundance of what were previously thought to be rare occurrences, or the presence of something that wasn‚Äôt expected to exist under the conditions or with the properties we wound up observing. That‚Äôs definitely the case when it comes to the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, which is our largest, most powerful space telescope ever designed, launched, and operated. In particular, with its superior infrared capabilities, JWST has revealed to us a plethora of ultra-distant galaxies: including nearly all of the currently most-distant astronomical objects . While the most discussed puzzles about these ultra-distant galaxies have been their great abundance and extreme brightness, another aspect that‚Äôs just as puzzling is their dust content. In particular, with so little star-formation having occurred over such a short time period, the key question is, ‚Äúhow do these galaxies make so much dust, and so soon?‚Äù In a remarkable new study led by Elizabeth Tarantino , we may have just discovered the answer in a counterintuitive way: by examining the dust within a galaxy right in our own cosmic backyard. Here‚Äôs the fascinating story. This selection of 55 galaxies from the JWST‚Äôs GLASS Early Release Science program spans a variety of ranges in redshift and mass. This helps teach us what shapes galaxies take on over a range of masses and stages in cosmic time/evolution, revealing a number of very massive, very early, yet very evolved-looking galaxies. However, it‚Äôs only at relatively late cosmic times, from about ~550 million years onward, that practically every galaxy starts possessing large amounts of dust; prior to that, the dust fraction is variable, with some galaxies having plenty of dust already but others, particularly among the faintest galaxies, displaying little evidence for dust. Credit : C. Jacobs, K. Glazebrook et al., arXiv:2208.06516, 2022 Above, you can see a selection of early galaxies imaged by JWST: galaxies whose light was emitted billions of years ago, in a Universe where only 13.8 billion years have elapsed since the earliest moments of the hot Big Bang. At the greatest cosmic distances of all, JWST can take us back more than 13.5 billion years in cosmic history, to an epoch when the Universe was just 2% of its current age. This is very exciting, and not just for the obvious reason that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre seeing farther back in cosmic history, and closer to the Big Bang, than ever before.‚Äù That‚Äôs because, over the course of the history of the Universe, stars didn‚Äôt form at a consistent rate, nor did they form all at once. Instead, our cosmic star-formation history started off as a trickle: where stars did indeed form during the first few hundred million years of cosmic history, but represent far less than 1% of the stars cumulatively formed from the Big Bang until now. Over time, the star-formation rate rose and rose, until it reached a peak ‚Äî known as cosmic noon ‚Äî that occurred about 3 billion years after the Big Bang. That peak was sustained for a couple of billion years, but then began to fall off, and fell further and further and further, continuing to fall even today. At the present time, the star-formation rate is only 3% of what it was at cosmic noon. The star-formation rate in the Universe is a function of redshift, which is itself a function of cosmic time. The overall rate, (left) is derived from both ultraviolet and infrared observations, and is remarkably consistent across time and space. Note that star formation, today, is only a few percent of what it was at its peak (between 3-5%), and that the majority of stars were formed in the first ~5 billion years of our cosmic history. Only about ~15% of all stars, at maximum, have formed over the past 4.6 billion years. Direct measures of star-formation are important, and the JWST era has brought with it exquisite measurements for the star-formation rate at the greatest of redshifts. Credit : P. Madau & M. Dickinson, 2014, ARAA If that‚Äôs what the star-formation history of the Universe is, then you‚Äôd expect something else would be exquisitely correlated with it: the formation of dust in the Universe as well. The Universe wasn‚Äôt born with any dust after the Big Bang; dust requires the existence of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, and following the Big Bang, more than 99.999999% of the atoms in the Universe, by mass, were hydrogen and helium, making the formation of dust all but impossible. However, the Universe does indeed create heavy elements once the first stars begin forming. Nuclear fusion doesn‚Äôt just fuse hydrogen into helium, but helium into carbon, carbon into neon and oxygen, and still heavier elements (silicon, sulfur, iron, etc.) beyond those. Once those heavy elements have come into existence, there are a variety of mechanisms by which the Universe creates cosmic dust, including: from outflows arising from young, massive stars, within protoplanetary disks and even in halos surrounding young protostars, from stars, nearing the end of their lives, that reach the asymptotic giant branch stage, and in stellar deaths and cataclysms such as supernovae and planetary nebulae. This image shows a variety of model simulations for how Herbig-Haro 30 (HH30) should appear in a variety of wavelengths of light, compared with the actual data at bottoms. As you can see, a variety of dust-particle sizes are needed to reproduce what‚Äôs observed, with lower dust masses and a fainter central protostar offering the best matches to the data. Credit : R. Tazaki et al., Astrophysical Journal, 2025 Unfortunately, direct observations of dust are extremely difficult to conduct unless an object is relatively close by: in our cosmic vicinity. Sure, there‚Äôs often dust in the plane of a disk-like galaxy (such as a spiral galaxy), but that dust is usually only apparent when you can resolve the different components of the galaxy at high resolution. This is made more difficult, especially in the early Universe, by the fact that cosmic dust is normally confined, where it shows up in significant abundances, to very dense regions that are typically on the scale of an individual stellar system, rather than being extended over an entire galaxy. So what chance do we have to trace the origin of cosmic dust, and to answer the question of, ‚Äúwhere did this cosmic dust come from so early on in cosmic history, back before most of the Universe‚Äôs stars had an opportunity to form?‚Äù You can tell if a galaxy has copious amounts of dust in it indirectly, even if the galaxy is far away and not well-resolved, by looking at the signatures within that galaxy of light absorption. Because dust is made of grains of a finite size, dust is transparent to long wavelengths of light (those with wavelength significantly longer than the physical sizes of the dust grains), absorbs short wavelengths of light (with shorter wavelengths than the dust grain‚Äôs sizes), and partially absorbs light of intermediate wavelengths. With spectroscopic measurements, we can do even better at pinpointing the abundance of dust. Using those techniques, we‚Äôve probed many of the earliest galaxies in the Universe, including those found with JWST, for their dust contents, and have learned many valuable lessons from doing so , including about the existence of GELDAs: Galaxies with spectroscopically-derived Extremely Low Dust Attenuation . This plot shows galaxies from the first ~1.5 billion years of cosmic history, color-coded by redshift and plotted by their metallicity (x-axis) as a function of the dust-to-stellar mass ratios (y-axis) found within them. The majority of low-metallicity galaxies are also dust-poor and are known as GELDAs, dominating the very early Universe, while later-time, more dust-rich galaxies are much more enriched in heavy elements. Credit : D. Burgarella et al., Astronomy & Astrophysics accepted/arXiv:2504.13118v2, 2025 But even with these discoveries, the ‚Äúorigin of dust‚Äù puzzle persists. Among the earliest galaxies, those coming from the first 550 million years of cosmic history, an impressive 17% of them still have large amounts of dust. From the next ~1 billion years of cosmic history, 74% of them are rich in dust. And after that, nearly all galaxies show strong evidence for the abundant presence of dust. Moreover, although there‚Äôs a correlation between the abundance of heavy elements (what astronomers call metallicity) in a galaxy with the amount of dust that‚Äôs present in that same galaxy, the correlation isn‚Äôt 1-to-1: there are plenty of low-metallicity galaxies, even from very early on in cosmic history, that still possess large quantities of dust. So why is that, and where did that dust come from? In order to answer that directly, we‚Äôd have to look at those early galaxies up close, in high-resolution, to see where the dust both: is being generated within them, and is displaying the strongest signatures of existence. Of course, even with the greatest observatories we have today, including Hubble, JWST, ALMA, and the large suite of ground based optical, infrared, and radio observatories at humanity‚Äôs disposal, the vast distances to these small, faint, infant galaxies is too much of a barrier even for our impressive arsenal of astronomical tools. However, there is another way to get an answer ‚Äî albeit a more indirect answer ‚Äî by looking at galaxies that can be found nearby, except with similar properties to these ultra-distant, low-metallicity, dust-plentiful galaxies. This multi-panel diagram shows the isolated, low-mass dwarf galaxy Sextans A, including a portion of the star-forming region imaged by JWST, with a particular set of clumps corresponding to particularly complex, dust-rich regions highlighted by JWST. Credit : E.J. Tarantino et al., arXiv:2512.04060, 2025 That‚Äôs what a team led by Dr. Elizabeth Tarantino did with JWST , by choosing to look at the nearby dwarf galaxy Sextans A. Sextans A, as you can see above, is a very interesting object that‚Äôs right on the edge of our Local Group: located about 4.6 million light-years away. Sextans A is located far away not just from the Milky Way, but from Andromeda, Triangulum, Bode‚Äôs galaxy, and all other large galaxies in our vicinity. In other words, it‚Äôs an extremely isolated galaxy, a low-mass galaxy, and an extremely metal-poor galaxy all in one: a galaxy that, in many ways, resembles the early, primitive galaxies from the early Universe. The full extent of Sextans A, in particular, is shown in panel ‚ÄúA‚Äù above. The highlighted region in panel A was imaged by JWST as part of this latest research work, and is shown in the large panel B. In particular, many different JWST filters were used, so ‚Äî for example ‚Äî the region within the green box in panel B can be highlighted in filters from between 3.0 and 3.6 microns (C), between 5.6 and 10.0 microns (D), or between 10 and 15 microns (E), revealing the same region of space in different wavelengths of light. The shorter wavelengths of light largely are good at highlighting stars, particularly the presence of evolved red giant stars, which appear abundantly in panel C but not in panels D or E. The longer wavelengths of light, however, are better at highlighting much cooler clumps of heated gas and dust, typically at below-freezing temperatures. There are, however, some regions that appear bright in all three panels, such as the region in the highlighted white, dotted circle. And those features correspond to something very special: a population of a specific type of molecule known as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Graphene, in its ideal configuration, is a defect-free network of carbon atoms bound into a perfectly hexagonal arrangement. It can be viewed as an infinite array of aromatic molecules. For a finite array, some of those carbon atoms will be bound to hydrogen atoms, resulting in an aromatic hydrocarbon instead. Credit : AlexanderAIUS/Core-Materials/flickr The name polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon might sound complicated, but it‚Äôs relatively straightforward. Hydrogen is the most common and abundant element in the Universe, and carbon is the first heavy element you make once stars first begin to form. While hydrogen and helium persist as the two most common species of atom to exist in the Universe, carbon is pretty common too, coming in at number four, with only oxygen reaching a greater abundance in the number three spot. When carbon and hydrogen atoms bind together, in any configuration, to make a molecule, that molecule is known as a hydrocarbon. There are plenty of molecules that exist, chemically, that are composed of carbon and hydrogen in ringed configurations ‚Äî such as benzene ‚Äî where the various carbon atoms are linked together in rings of six carbon atoms apiece; the geometry of carbon bonding supports these bond angles as a more stable configuration over configurations with either greater or fewer numbers of carbon atoms. Wherever the ringed configuration exists, we call that an aromatic molecule. So that explains the ‚Äúaromatic hydrocarbon‚Äù part, and then instead of single-ringed molecules, many aromatic species actually have multiple ‚Äúcarbon ring‚Äù configurations linked up together. That‚Äôs what makes a molecule polycyclic, and hence that‚Äôs what a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is. Whereas ‚Äúheated dust‚Äù emits across a wide variety of infrared wavelengths, in a temperature-dependent fashion, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are excited by a few specific wavelengths: at 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 microns. This four-panel image is specifically focused on wavelengths of 3.3 microns, 7.7 microns, and 11.3 microns: wavelengths at which polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules exhibit the strongest emission signatures when heated by an external source. Credit : E.J. Tarantino et al., arXiv:2512.04060, 2025 Whereas, above, the regions that appear in the 15 micron window (panel D) correspond to general thermal emission, the regions that are also excessively bright in those three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon wavelength windows correspond not only to those molecules, but to a substantial density of those molecules in a region where they‚Äôre being heated ‚Äî and thus, from a molecule‚Äôs point of view, excited into a state where they can copiously emit energy ‚Äî by an external source. Now, even at ‚Äújust‚Äù a distance of 4.6 million light-years away, none of the telescopes we have in our arsenal are capable of resolving what that external source is, but we have a comprehensive enough knowledge of astrophysics to know what‚Äôs going on: these are young protostars, or clumps of matter in the process of giving birth to new stars, that are heating up and exciting the molecules that are present surrounding them. We see these up close here in our own Milky Way, often in great detail, but when we see them from far away, all they look like is small, shielded clumps of glowing dust that appear bright at these three specific wavelengths: 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 microns. So even though this galaxy is an extremely low-metallicity galaxy, with only about 3% of the amount of heavy elements (oxygen, carbon, neon, iron, etc.) found in our Solar System, we can be certain that it has plenty of dust inside of it. That‚Äôs big news. But these protostars, or young stellar objects (YSOs) as they‚Äôre sometimes called, aren‚Äôt sites of dust production, they‚Äôre just the sites where you can observe the dust‚Äôs presence. So where is it getting created? The dying red giant star, R Sculptoris, exhibits a very unusual set of ejecta when viewed in millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths: revealing a spiral structure. This is thought to be due to the presence of a binary companion: something our own Sun lacks but that approximately half of the stars in the universe possess. Stars lose approximately half of their mass ‚Äî some more, and some less ‚Äî as they evolve through the red giant and AGB phases and into an eventual planetary nebula/white dwarf combination. Credit : ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO)/M. Maercker et al. Again, we know the answer from looking nearby: a very large producer of cosmic dust are stars like R Sculptoris, shown above, which is known as an AGB star, or a star on the asymptotic giant branch of stellar evolution. During this phase ‚Äî one of the final phases in the lives of all but the absolutely most massive stars ‚Äî an extraordinarily large amount of dust can be produced. In fact, for every ‚Äúsolar mass‚Äù worth of stars that enters the AGB phase, a few percent of that mass can be converted into dust, which is a remarkably significant amount of dust by any metric. While the aforementioned young stellar objects may be glowing copiously with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules, they aren‚Äôt the sites from which the dust was produced; they‚Äôre merely the locations from which the dust can be detected from its characteristic glow, proving it ubiquitously exists. But separately, independent of those glowing protostars, we can not only identify and look at where the AGB stars within Sextans A are, we can also take a spectrum of those AGB stars, and determine what the properties and composition of the dust are that is actively being produced by those AGB stars within Sextans A. AGB stars have existed all throughout cosmic history, and are expected to have played a major role in cosmic dust production for as long as stars have existed. What‚Äôs fascinating, however, is that the total fraction of heavy elements that exist within the AGB star itself lead to a relationship between what the specific element ratios of the dust that it produces turns out to be. In particular, a low fraction of heavy elements leads to iron-rich but silicon-poor dust production, while greater fractions would lead to a significant silicon presence as well, as a recent companion study has demonstrated . This graph shows a spectrum of an Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star in the Sextans A galaxy. It compares data collected by NASA‚Äôs James Webb Space Telescope with models of mostly silicate-free dust and dust containing at least 5% silicates. Note that a silicon-free spectrum and a spectrum that includes silicon at the 0.8% abundance level cannot be distinguished by the current data, but a 5% silicon contribution can be ruled out. Credit : NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Joseph Olmsted (STScI) This is remarkable, because here in the modern Milky Way, a mix of three key ingredients are required to make dust: carbon, silicon, and iron. But back in the early Universe, not all of those ingredients were abundant, and so it was a bit puzzling as to whether dust could be produced at all by the conventionally understood mechanisms. The Sextans A observations, definitively, put any doubts to rest: even with barely any silicon at all, dust is still getting generated, even if AGB stars are hardly producing any silicon at all. It‚Äôs like learning you can bake a cake without flour, and that under the right conditions, simply using butter and sugar will do. While today‚Äôs dust that we observe up close might be predominantly composed of silicate grains, dust in the early Universe, although different from today‚Äôs dust, can still be brought into existence. With the power of JWST and a mix of complex theoretical modeling and clever observational techniques, we‚Äôve just revealed how it happens in Sextans A, which lacks much of the evolved property that our own Milky Way possesses, but which closely mirrors what should have happened early on in cosmic history: back when we‚Äôre seeing the dusty JWST galaxies that have relatively small fractions of heavy elements within them. At long last, after decades of wondering how the most distant galaxies of all could possibly produce dust at such early times, we‚Äôve finally learned that ‚Äútoo much, too soon,‚Äù is the wrong question to be asking. Apparently, the recipe our own galaxy uses wasn‚Äôt the recipe the Universe followed back in its more pristine past! This article Cosmic dust: ‚Äútoo much, too soon‚Äù no longer! is featured on Big Think .tive ·     on of velocity, as it relates to distance and time? It‚Äôs the overall change in distance divided by the overall change in time. This makes velocity an example of a concept known as a rate: the amount that one quantity (distance) changes dependent on how another quantity (time) changes as well. You can have a constant velocity (without any acceleration) or you can have a velocity that evolves with time (with either positive or negative acceleration). You can have an instantaneous velocity (i.e., where you measure your velocity at one specific moment in time) or an average velocity (i.e., your velocity over a certain interval, whether a part or the entirety of a journey). However, if something is in constant motion, then the relationship between distance, velocity, and time becomes very simple: the distance you traverse is simply your velocity multiplied by the time you spend in motion. (Distance = velocity * time.) When a person moves from one location to another, they are traveling a total amount of distance in a total amount of time. Figuring out the relationship between distance and time quantitatively did not happen until the time of Galileo and Newton, at which point Zeno‚Äôs famous paradox was resolved not by mathematics or logic or philosophy, but by a physical understanding of the Universe. Credit : Public Domain This is how we arrive at the first correct resolution of the classical ‚ÄúZeno‚Äôs paradox‚Äù as commonly stated. The reason that objects can move from one location to another (i.e., travel a finite distance) in a finite amount of time is not because their velocities are not only always finite, but because they do not change in time unless acted upon by an outside force: a statement equivalent to Newton‚Äôs first law of motion . If you consider a person like Atalanta, who moves at a constant speed, you‚Äôll find that she can cover any distance you choose in a specific amount of time: a time prescribed by the equation that relates distance to velocity, time = distance/velocity. While this isn‚Äôt necessarily the most common form that we encounter Newton‚Äôs first law in (e.g., objects at rest remain at rest and objects in motion remain in constant motion unless acted on by an outside force), it very much arises from Newton‚Äôs principles when applied to the special case of constant motion. If you consider the total distance you need to travel and then halve the distance that you‚Äôre traveling, it will take you only half the time to traverse it as it would to traverse the full distance. To travel (¬Ω + ¬º + ‚Öõ + ‚Ä¶) the total distance you‚Äôre trying to cover, it takes you (¬Ω + ¬º + ‚Öõ + ‚Ä¶) the total amount of time to do so. And this works for any distance, no matter how arbitrarily tiny, you seek to cover. Whether it‚Äôs a massive particle or a massless quantum of energy (like light) that‚Äôs moving, there‚Äôs a straightforward relationship between distance, velocity, and time. If you know how fast your object is going, and if it‚Äôs in constant motion, distance and time are directly proportional. Credit : John D. Norton/University of Pittsburgh For anyone interested in the physical world, this should be enough to resolve Zeno‚Äôs paradox. It works whether space (and time) is continuous or discrete; it works at both a classical level and a quantum level; it doesn‚Äôt rely on philosophical or logical assumptions. For objects that move in this Universe, simple Newtonian physics is completely sufficient to solve Zeno‚Äôs paradox. But, as with most things in our classical Universe, if you go down to the quantum level, an entirely new paradox can emerge, known as the quantum Zeno effect . Certain physical phenomena only happen due to the quantum properties of matter and energy, like quantum tunneling through a thin and solid barrier, or the radioactive decay of an unstable atomic nucleus. In order to go from one quantum state to another, your quantum system needs to behave like a wave: with a wavefunction that spreads out over time. Eventually, the wavefunction will have spread out sufficiently so that there will be a non-zero probability of winding up in a lower-energy quantum state. This is how you can wind up occupying a more energetically favorable state even when there isn‚Äôt a classical path that allows you to get there: through the process of quantum tunneling. By firing a pulse of light at a semi-transparent/semi-reflective thin medium, researchers can measure the time it must take for these photons to tunnel through the barrier to the other side. Although the step of tunneling itself may be instantaneous, the traveling particles are still limited by the speed of light. Credit : J. Liang, L. Zhu & L.V. Wang, 2018, Light: Science & Applications Remarkably, there‚Äôs a way to inhibit quantum tunneling, and in the most extreme scenario, to prevent it from occurring at all. All you need to do is this: just observe and/or measure the system you‚Äôre monitoring before the wavefunction can sufficiently spread out so that it overlaps with a lower-energy state it can occupy. Most physicists are keen to refer to this type of interaction as ‚Äúcollapsing the wavefunction,‚Äù as you‚Äôre basically causing whatever quantum system you‚Äôre measuring to act ‚Äúparticle-like‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwave-like.‚Äù But a wavefunction collapse is just one interpretation of what‚Äôs happening, and the phenomenon of quantum tunneling is real regardless of your chosen interpretation of quantum physics. Another ‚Äî perhaps more general ‚Äî way of looking at the quantum version of Zeno‚Äôs paradox is that you‚Äôre restricting the possible quantum states your system can be in through the act of observation and/or measurement. If you make this measurement too close in time to your prior measurement, there will be an infinitesimal (or even a zero) probability of tunneling into your desired state. If you keep your quantum system interacting with the environment, you can suppress the inherently quantum effects, leaving you with only the classical outcomes as possibilities: effectively forbidding quantum tunneling from occurring. When a quantum particle approaches a barrier, it will most frequently interact with it. But there is a finite probability of not only reflecting off of the barrier, but tunneling through it. If you were to measure the position of the particle continuously, however, including upon its interaction with the barrier, this tunneling effect could be entirely suppressed via the quantum Zeno effect.

With those relationships in hand ‚Äî i.e., that the distance you traverse is your velocity multiplied by the duration of time you‚Äôre in motion ‚Äî we can learn exactly how motion occurs in a quantitative sense. Yes, in order to cover the full distance from one location to another, you have to first cover half that distance, then half the remaining distance, then half of what‚Äôs left, etc., which would take an infinite number of ‚Äúhalving‚Äù steps before you actually reach your destination. But the time it takes to take each ‚Äúnext step‚Äù also halves with respect to each prior step, so motion over a finite distance always takes a finite amount of time for any object in motion. Even today, the Zeno‚Äôs paradox puzzle still remains an interesting exercise for mathematicians and philosophers. Not only is the solution reliant on physics, but physicists have even extended it to quantum phenomena, where a new quantum Zeno effect ‚Äî not a paradox, but a suppression of purely quantum effects ‚Äî emerges. For motion, its possibility, and how it occurs in our physical reality, mathematics alone is not enough to arrive at a satisfactory resolution. As in all scientific fields, only the Universe itself can actually be the final arbiter for how reality behaves. Thanks to physics, Zeno‚Äôs original paradox gets resolved, and now we can all finally understand exactly how. A version of this article was first published in February of 2022. It was updated in January of 2026.

Instead of merely finding fainter or more distant versions of what we had already established was out there, we often find things that we didn‚Äôt even know we ought to be looking for previously. They might include new classes or populations of astronomical objects, an unexpected abundance of what were previously thought to be rare occurrences, or the presence of something that wasn‚Äôt expected to exist under the conditions or with the properties we wound up observing. That‚Äôs definitely the case when it comes to the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, which is our largest, most powerful space telescope ever designed, launched, and operated. In particular, with its superior infrared capabilities, JWST has revealed to us a plethora of ultra-distant galaxies: including nearly all of the currently most-distant astronomical objects . While the most discussed puzzles about these ultra-distant galaxies have been their great abundance and extreme brightness, another aspect that‚Äôs just as puzzling is their dust content. In particular, with so little star-formation having occurred over such a short time period, the key question is, ‚Äúhow do these galaxies make so much dust, and so soon?‚Äù In a remarkable new study led by Elizabeth Tarantino , we may have just discovered the answer in a counterintuitive way: by examining the dust within a galaxy right in our own cosmic backyard. Here‚Äôs the fascinating story. This selection of 55 galaxies from the JWST‚Äôs GLASS Early Release Science program spans a variety of ranges in redshift and mass. This helps teach us what shapes galaxies take on over a range of masses and stages in cosmic time/evolution, revealing a number of very massive, very early, yet very evolved-looking galaxies. However, it‚Äôs only at relatively late cosmic times, from about ~550 million years onward, that practically every galaxy starts possessing large amounts of dust; prior to that, the dust fraction is variable, with some galaxies having plenty of dust already but others, particularly among the faintest galaxies, displaying little evidence for dust. Credit : C. Jacobs, K. Glazebrook et al., arXiv:2208.06516, 2022 Above, you can see a selection of early galaxies imaged by JWST: galaxies whose light was emitted billions of years ago, in a Universe where only 13.8 billion years have elapsed since the earliest moments of the hot Big Bang. At the greatest cosmic distances of all, JWST can take us back more than 13.5 billion years in cosmic history, to an epoch when the Universe was just 2% of its current age. This is very exciting, and not just for the obvious reason that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre seeing farther back in cosmic history, and closer to the Big Bang, than ever before.‚Äù That‚Äôs because, over the course of the history of the Universe, stars didn‚Äôt form at a consistent rate, nor did they form all at once. Instead, our cosmic star-formation history started off as a trickle: where stars did indeed form during the first few hundred million years of cosmic history, but represent far less than 1% of the stars cumulatively formed from the Big Bang until now. Over time, the star-formation rate rose and rose, until it reached a peak ‚Äî known as cosmic noon ‚Äî that occurred about 3 billion years after the Big Bang. That peak was sustained for a couple of billion years, but then began to fall off, and fell further and further and further, continuing to fall even today. At the present time, the star-formation rate is only 3% of what it was at cosmic noon. The star-formation rate in the Universe is a function of redshift, which is itself a function of cosmic time. The overall rate, (left) is derived from both ultraviolet and infrared observations, and is remarkably consistent across time and space. Note that star formation, today, is only a few percent of what it was at its peak (between 3-5%), and that the majority of stars were formed in the first ~5 billion years of our cosmic history. Only about ~15% of all stars, at maximum, have formed over the past 4.6 billion years. Direct measures of star-formation are important, and the JWST era has brought with it exquisite measurements for the star-formation rate at the greatest of redshifts. Credit : P. Madau & M. Dickinson, 2014, ARAA If that‚Äôs what the star-formation history of the Universe is, then you‚Äôd expect something else would be exquisitely correlated with it: the formation of dust in the Universe as well. The Universe wasn‚Äôt born with any dust after the Big Bang; dust requires the existence of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, and following the Big Bang, more than 99.999999% of the atoms in the Universe, by mass, were hydrogen and helium, making the formation of dust all but impossible. However, the Universe does indeed create heavy elements once the first stars begin forming. Nuclear fusion doesn‚Äôt just fuse hydrogen into helium, but helium into carbon, carbon into neon and oxygen, and still heavier elements (silicon, sulfur, iron, etc.) beyond those. Once those heavy elements have come into existence, there are a variety of mechanisms by which the Universe creates cosmic dust, including: from outflows arising from young, massive stars, within protoplanetary disks and even in halos surrounding young protostars, from stars, nearing the end of their lives, that reach the asymptotic giant branch stage, and in stellar deaths and cataclysms such as supernovae and planetary nebulae. This image shows a variety of model simulations for how Herbig-Haro 30 (HH30) should appear in a variety of wavelengths of light, compared with the actual data at bottoms. As you can see, a variety of dust-particle sizes are needed to reproduce what‚Äôs observed, with lower dust masses and a fainter central protostar offering the best matches to the data. Credit : R. Tazaki et al., Astrophysical Journal, 2025 Unfortunately, direct observations of dust are extremely difficult to conduct unless an object is relatively close by: in our cosmic vicinity. Sure, there‚Äôs often dust in the plane of a disk-like galaxy (such as a spiral galaxy), but that dust is usually only apparent when you can resolve the different components of the galaxy at high resolution. This is made more difficult, especially in the early Universe, by the fact that cosmic dust is normally confined, where it shows up in significant abundances, to very dense regions that are typically on the scale of an individual stellar system, rather than being extended over an entire galaxy. So what chance do we have to trace the origin of cosmic dust, and to answer the question of, ‚Äúwhere did this cosmic dust come from so early on in cosmic history, back before most of the Universe‚Äôs stars had an opportunity to form?‚Äù You can tell if a galaxy has copious amounts of dust in it indirectly, even if the galaxy is far away and not well-resolved, by looking at the signatures within that galaxy of light absorption. Because dust is made of grains of a finite size, dust is transparent to long wavelengths of light (those with wavelength significantly longer than the physical sizes of the dust grains), absorbs short wavelengths of light (with shorter wavelengths than the dust grain‚Äôs sizes), and partially absorbs light of intermediate wavelengths. With spectroscopic measurements, we can do even better at pinpointing the abundance of dust. Using those techniques, we‚Äôve probed many of the earliest galaxies in the Universe, including those found with JWST, for their dust contents, and have learned many valuable lessons from doing so , including about the existence of GELDAs: Galaxies with spectroscopically-derived Extremely Low Dust Attenuation . This plot shows galaxies from the first ~1.5 billion years of cosmic history, color-coded by redshift and plotted by their metallicity (x-axis) as a function of the dust-to-stellar mass ratios (y-axis) found within them. The majority of low-metallicity galaxies are also dust-poor and are known as GELDAs, dominating the very early Universe, while later-time, more dust-rich galaxies are much more enriched in heavy elements. Credit : D. Burgarella et al., Astronomy & Astrophysics accepted/arXiv:2504.13118v2, 2025 But even with these discoveries, the ‚Äúorigin of dust‚Äù puzzle persists. Among the earliest galaxies, those coming from the first 550 million years of cosmic history, an impressive 17% of them still have large amounts of dust. From the next ~1 billion years of cosmic history, 74% of them are rich in dust. And after that, nearly all galaxies show strong evidence for the abundant presence of dust. Moreover, although there‚Äôs a correlation between the abundance of heavy elements (what astronomers call metallicity) in a galaxy with the amount of dust that‚Äôs present in that same galaxy, the correlation isn‚Äôt 1-to-1: there are plenty of low-metallicity galaxies, even from very early on in cosmic history, that still possess large quantities of dust. So why is that, and where did that dust come from? In order to answer that directly, we‚Äôd have to look at those early galaxies up close, in high-resolution, to see where the dust both: is being generated within them, and is displaying the strongest signatures of existence. Of course, even with the greatest observatories we have today, including Hubble, JWST, ALMA, and the large suite of ground based optical, infrared, and radio observatories at humanity‚Äôs disposal, the vast distances to these small, faint, infant galaxies is too much of a barrier even for our impressive arsenal of astronomical tools. However, there is another way to get an answer ‚Äî albeit a more indirect answer ‚Äî by looking at galaxies that can be found nearby, except with similar properties to these ultra-distant, low-metallicity, dust-plentiful galaxies. This multi-panel diagram shows the isolated, low-mass dwarf galaxy Sextans A, including a portion of the star-forming region imaged by JWST, with a particular set of clumps corresponding to particularly complex, dust-rich regions highlighted by JWST. Credit : E.J. Tarantino et al., arXiv:2512.04060, 2025 That‚Äôs what a team led by Dr. Elizabeth Tarantino did with JWST , by choosing to look at the nearby dwarf galaxy Sextans A. Sextans A, as you can see above, is a very interesting object that‚Äôs right on the edge of our Local Group: located about 4.6 million light-years away. Sextans A is located far away not just from the Milky Way, but from Andromeda, Triangulum, Bode‚Äôs galaxy, and all other large galaxies in our vicinity. In other words, it‚Äôs an extremely isolated galaxy, a low-mass galaxy, and an extremely metal-poor galaxy all in one: a galaxy that, in many ways, resembles the early, primitive galaxies from the early Universe. The full extent of Sextans A, in particular, is shown in panel ‚ÄúA‚Äù above. The highlighted region in panel A was imaged by JWST as part of this latest research work, and is shown in the large panel B. In particular, many different JWST filters were used, so ‚Äî for example ‚Äî the region within the green box in panel B can be highlighted in filters from between 3.0 and 3.6 microns (C), between 5.6 and 10.0 microns (D), or between 10 and 15 microns (E), revealing the same region of space in different wavelengths of light. The shorter wavelengths of light largely are good at highlighting stars, particularly the presence of evolved red giant stars, which appear abundantly in panel C but not in panels D or E. The longer wavelengths of light, however, are better at highlighting much cooler clumps of heated gas and dust, typically at below-freezing temperatures. There are, however, some regions that appear bright in all three panels, such as the region in the highlighted white, dotted circle. And those features correspond to something very special: a population of a specific type of molecule known as a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Graphene, in its ideal configuration, is a defect-free network of carbon atoms bound into a perfectly hexagonal arrangement. It can be viewed as an infinite array of aromatic molecules. For a finite array, some of those carbon atoms will be bound to hydrogen atoms, resulting in an aromatic hydrocarbon instead. Credit : AlexanderAIUS/Core-Materials/flickr The name polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon might sound complicated, but it‚Äôs relatively straightforward. Hydrogen is the most common and abundant element in the Universe, and carbon is the first heavy element you make once stars first begin to form. While hydrogen and helium persist as the two most common species of atom to exist in the Universe, carbon is pretty common too, coming in at number four, with only oxygen reaching a greater abundance in the number three spot. When carbon and hydrogen atoms bind together, in any configuration, to make a molecule, that molecule is known as a hydrocarbon. There are plenty of molecules that exist, chemically, that are composed of carbon and hydrogen in ringed configurations ‚Äî such as benzene ‚Äî where the various carbon atoms are linked together in rings of six carbon atoms apiece; the geometry of carbon bonding supports these bond angles as a more stable configuration over configurations with either greater or fewer numbers of carbon atoms. Wherever the ringed configuration exists, we call that an aromatic molecule. So that explains the ‚Äúaromatic hydrocarbon‚Äù part, and then instead of single-ringed molecules, many aromatic species actually have multiple ‚Äúcarbon ring‚Äù configurations linked up together. That‚Äôs what makes a molecule polycyclic, and hence that‚Äôs what a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is. Whereas ‚Äúheated dust‚Äù emits across a wide variety of infrared wavelengths, in a temperature-dependent fashion, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are excited by a few specific wavelengths: at 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 microns. This four-panel image is specifically focused on wavelengths of 3.3 microns, 7.7 microns, and 11.3 microns: wavelengths at which polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules exhibit the strongest emission signatures when heated by an external source. Credit : E.J. Tarantino et al., arXiv:2512.04060, 2025 Whereas, above, the regions that appear in the 15 micron window (panel D) correspond to general thermal emission, the regions that are also excessively bright in those three polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon wavelength windows correspond not only to those molecules, but to a substantial density of those molecules in a region where they‚Äôre being heated ‚Äî and thus, from a molecule‚Äôs point of view, excited into a state where they can copiously emit energy ‚Äî by an external source. Now, even at ‚Äújust‚Äù a distance of 4.6 million light-years away, none of the telescopes we have in our arsenal are capable of resolving what that external source is, but we have a comprehensive enough knowledge of astrophysics to know what‚Äôs going on: these are young protostars, or clumps of matter in the process of giving birth to new stars, that are heating up and exciting the molecules that are present surrounding them. We see these up close here in our own Milky Way, often in great detail, but when we see them from far away, all they look like is small, shielded clumps of glowing dust that appear bright at these three specific wavelengths: 3.3, 7.7, and 11.3 microns. So even though this galaxy is an extremely low-metallicity galaxy, with only about 3% of the amount of heavy elements (oxygen, carbon, neon, iron, etc.) found in our Solar System, we can be certain that it has plenty of dust inside of it. That‚Äôs big news. But these protostars, or young stellar objects (YSOs) as they‚Äôre sometimes called, aren‚Äôt sites of dust production, they‚Äôre just the sites where you can observe the dust‚Äôs presence. So where is it getting created? The dying red giant star, R Sculptoris, exhibits a very unusual set of ejecta when viewed in millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths: revealing a spiral structure. This is thought to be due to the presence of a binary companion: something our own Sun lacks but that approximately half of the stars in the universe possess. Stars lose approximately half of their mass ‚Äî some more, and some less ‚Äî as they evolve through the red giant and AGB phases and into an eventual planetary nebula/white dwarf combination. Credit : ALMA (ESO/NAOJ/NRAO)/M. Maercker et al. Again, we know the answer from looking nearby: a very large producer of cosmic dust are stars like R Sculptoris, shown above, which is known as an AGB star, or a star on the asymptotic giant branch of stellar evolution. During this phase ‚Äî one of the final phases in the lives of all but the absolutely most massive stars ‚Äî an extraordinarily large amount of dust can be produced. In fact, for every ‚Äúsolar mass‚Äù worth of stars that enters the AGB phase, a few percent of that mass can be converted into dust, which is a remarkably significant amount of dust by any metric. While the aforementioned young stellar objects may be glowing copiously with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules, they aren‚Äôt the sites from which the dust was produced; they‚Äôre merely the locations from which the dust can be detected from its characteristic glow, proving it ubiquitously exists. But separately, independent of those glowing protostars, we can not only identify and look at where the AGB stars within Sextans A are, we can also take a spectrum of those AGB stars, and determine what the properties and composition of the dust are that is actively being produced by those AGB stars within Sextans A. AGB stars have existed all throughout cosmic history, and are expected to have played a major role in cosmic dust production for as long as stars have existed. What‚Äôs fascinating, however, is that the total fraction of heavy elements that exist within the AGB star itself lead to a relationship between what the specific element ratios of the dust that it produces turns out to be. In particular, a low fraction of heavy elements leads to iron-rich but silicon-poor dust production, while greater fractions would lead to a significant silicon presence as well, as a recent companion study has demonstrated . This graph shows a spectrum of an Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star in the Sextans A galaxy. It compares data collected by NASA‚Äôs James Webb Space Telescope with models of mostly silicate-free dust and dust containing at least 5% silicates. Note that a silicon-free spectrum and a spectrum that includes silicon at the 0.8% abundance level cannot be distinguished by the current data, but a 5% silicon contribution can be ruled out. Credit : NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, Joseph Olmsted (STScI) This is remarkable, because here in the modern Milky Way, a mix of three key ingredients are required to make dust: carbon, silicon, and iron. But back in the early Universe, not all of those ingredients were abundant, and so it was a bit puzzling as to whether dust could be produced at all by the conventionally understood mechanisms. The Sextans A observations, definitively, put any doubts to rest: even with barely any silicon at all, dust is still getting generated, even if AGB stars are hardly producing any silicon at all. It‚Äôs like learning you can bake a cake without flour, and that under the right conditions, simply using butter and sugar will do. While today‚Äôs dust that we observe up close might be predominantly composed of silicate grains, dust in the early Universe, although different from today‚Äôs dust, can still be brought into existence. With the power of JWST and a mix of complex theoretical modeling and clever observational techniques, we‚Äôve just revealed how it happens in Sextans A, which lacks much of the evolved property that our own Milky Way possesses, but which closely mirrors what should have happened early on in cosmic history: back when we‚Äôre seeing the dusty JWST galaxies that have relatively small fractions of heavy elements within them. At long last, after decades of wondering how the most distant galaxies of all could possibly produce dust at such early times, we‚Äôve finally learned that ‚Äútoo much, too soon,‚Äù is the wrong question to be asking. Apparently, the recipe our own galaxy uses wasn‚Äôt the recipe the Universe followed back in its more pristine past!

During a recent collaboration with a major automaker, focusing on the employee development pathway for the upcoming year, one leader shared with us the following sentiment: ‚ÄúI just hope this is not another flavor of the month.‚Äù The comment resonated with the group, who felt somewhat exhausted and weary from the cycle that many organizations tend to follow. Sadly, there‚Äôs nothing new about this kind of reaction. Billions of dollars are spent annually on leadership development initiatives. Much of these investments go into single-shot programs that function as commodities in the marketplace of leadership development. However, there is limited empirical evidence demonstrating the return on investment. One reason for the limited impact is that most programs are not grounded in what we know about human development. We can and must do better. Here we share our vision for a more effective way to prepare individuals to serve and excel as leaders. Based on adult learning theory, systems thinking, human development, and leadership theory, this approach shifts development from program to system . The leadership system It‚Äôs unrealistic to believe that a one-day, quarterly classroom-based workshop will yield more effective leaders. While traditional classroom-based programs can be essential to a developmental experience, they contribute little to the long-term growth of leadership skills, competencies, and self-views. It is like putting a medical student through a few academic courses and expecting a competent surgeon at the end. The best path forward for any organization is to start building a system centered on leadership development. Here‚Äôs how. The starting point for creating a leader development system is to clarify a set of leadership principles . These principles serve as the foundation, providing a shared understanding of what it means to be an effective leader in your context . They represent the organization‚Äôs developmental roadmap. Whenever anyone, at any level, holds a leadership position, they understand what is expected of them. Ultimately, these principles support a leader‚Äôs growth and development. Hypothetical examples of leadership principles could include: building teams and people; strategic thinking; delivering results; demonstrating emotional and social intelligence; showing a commitment to lifelong learning; and displaying integrity. Ideally, this is a customized model developed by members of the organization, tailored to what is valued, needed, and essential for success. A small regional accounting firm in rural America will have different needs than a mid-sized manufacturing plant in urban Buenos Aires. The next step is to connect several aspects of organizational life. In other words, we begin to build the leadership system. A system can be defined as a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole. By intentionally integrating these components, you create a coherent system that is aligned, efficient, and more likely to guide behavior. While there are numerous connections we could emphasize, we have chosen to share six as starting points. When rooted in your principles and combined with a focus on development, the likelihood of individual growth increases. What we often see is that these elements exist, but they are rarely aligned and working together to help an individual grow. Assessment : One form of assessment is 360-degree feedback. Ideally, the assessment is customized and aligns with the organization‚Äôs leadership principles. By securing feedback from various stakeholders, it becomes clear where the individual needs to focus time and energy to develop as a leader. Personal development pathways : All employees can outline a path that aligns with the leadership principles. They can choose learning experiences, stretch assignments (see below), or other activities (e.g., serving on a nonprofit board) that correspond with these principles and offer opportunities for development and growth. Training and development : Take a continuous approach to training and development rather than an episodic or ‚Äúprogram-based‚Äù approach. Topics for quarterly retreats, online learning modules, emerging leader programs, and departmental retreats should reflect the leadership principles and remain aligned; at this point, they cannot be viewed as the ‚Äúflavor of the month,‚Äù as they are deeply embedded in the organization‚Äôs fundamental values. Stretch assignments : Stretch assignments are designed to challenge an individual to develop a specific capacity that aligns with the firm‚Äôs leadership principles. In other words, development is built into the experience. Stretch assignments may include high-visibility initiatives, turnaround assignments, working with high-profile clients, getting influence to get work done, and collaborating with challenging individuals. Performance coaching : Coaching and feedback are not a one-time or episodic activity but rather an ongoing and continuous process between managers and subordinates. The focus of the conversations? You guessed it ‚Äî the principles. After-action reviews and reflection should be prioritized following significant projects, and learning that is process- and growth-oriented is embedded within the process. Feedback may flow from the supervisor, peers, stakeholders, or other key individuals. Ongoing accountability and performance management: When a team member is not performing at the expected level, leaders should link the shortfall to the expectations outlined in the organization‚Äôs DNA. Whether they struggle to maintain emotional intelligence or build teams, there should always be a clear reason for the conversation, along with a developmental perspective. These six connections are just the beginning. The leadership development system can be integrated with other interventions, such as succession planning, work with an external coach, recognition, and job enlargement, to name a few. Conclusion The current results for many, if not most, leadership development initiatives are disappointing. If the opposite were true, we would see numerous exemplary organizations with strong leadership cultures as case studies, and scholars and consultancies would proudly highlight the developmental successes and the return on investment of our efforts. Most organizations are stuck in the flavor-of-the-month mode, and new thinking is required. The opportunity? Build leader development systems, not programs. ‚Äì For a deeper look at leadership development in practice, explore the How to Make a Leader podcast.

As a young man, he took undue pride in his accomplishments, was a slave to his lustful desires, and even stole pears for the sinful thrill of it. But by his early 30s, the saint-to-be began investigating the nature of good and evil ‚Äî a search that led him to the teachings of Christianity. Wondering if he should convert, and fearing what such a decision would say about his life so far, Augustine sought solace and reflection in a garden. There, he heard a child in the neighboring house singing: ‚ÄúTake up and read; take up and read.‚Äù Interpreting the chant as a divine sign, he set about to find a book, and the first one he happened upon was the letters of the Apostle Paul. Opening the book at random, his eyes fell upon Romans 13: ‚ÄúLet us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.‚Äù ‚ÄúI had no wish to read further, nor was there need,‚Äù Augustine wrote. ‚ÄúNo sooner had I reached the end of the verse than the light of certainty flooded my heart and all dark shades of doubt fled away.‚Äù He closed the book ‚Äî marking his place with ‚Äúa finger between the leaves‚Äù ‚Äî and went to tell the good news to his friend Alypius, who also converted. Joel Miller opens his new book, The Idea Machine , with this famous scene from The Confessions because it sparked his own epiphany. Not a spiritual conversion, mind. What struck Miller during his recent reread was how Augustine marked his place with his finger. This seemingly unremarkable detail ‚Äî a move any reader has made countless times ‚Äî forced Miller to reevaluate books as not simply a vessel for ideas, but as history‚Äôs most successful ‚Äúinformation technology.‚Äù In marking his place, Miller realized, Augustine could do more than return to the passage later. By marking other books, he could collect and connect seemingly disparate ideas. He could put authors who never meet in conversation to spark new insights or reappraise old ones. And in writing The Confessions , Augustine gave himself a platform to refine his own ideas. All of which expanded Augustine‚Äôs thinking beyond the natural limits of human cognition. ‚ÄúAs a bearer of ideas alone, the book deserves our admiration,‚Äù Miller writes. ‚ÄúBut reflecting on these additional facets of Augustine‚Äôs experience ‚Äî which the form of the book made possible ‚Äî we see that the book‚Äôs technological features and potentialities are equally important. Beyond what value the subject possesses, the object brings it forward and enables much else besides.‚Äù [Emphasis original.] Giving the book its due It may seem obvious that books are a technology, yet we rarely think about how they work. They just do. Read most any list of history‚Äôs important inventions , and you‚Äôre unlikely to find the humble book. The printing press will absolutely be present, possibly taking the top spot. You may even spy paper in the running. While such innovations helped create the modern book ‚Äî and we‚Äôll discuss them soon ‚Äî they are also distinct from the book as a technology in and of itself. So, if books were so transformative, why don‚Äôt we think about them the same way we do microchips, microwaves, and the steam engine? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the success of the book which makes us not even think about it,‚Äù Miller tells me during an interview. ‚ÄúThere is the old expression that familiarity breeds contempt. It actually breeds neglect more often than not. We fail to consider what a wonderful tool a book is and the many uses that it has.‚Äù To help readers better understand all the book can offer, Miller analogizes it with an information technology that feels more, well, technological: the computer. Like a computer, books have their ‚Äúhardware‚Äù ‚Äî the ink, leaves, heavy board, and glue binding it all together ‚Äî but they also have ‚Äúsoftware,‚Äù which are the ideas conveyed through them. On the software side, books preserve ideas so they can be used at a later date ‚Äî what Miller jokingly calls a ‚Äúcasual form of necromancy.‚Äù While books can‚Äôt contain any idea or experience with lossless fidelity, the variety and amount they can store is astounding. They can be written about law, science, medicine, and history. They can inform a reader about another person‚Äôs life or personal philosophy. They can even create vicarious experiences we would never enjoy in our daily lives, such as following the inner workings of an atom or exploring a fantasy world. This describes the software at its simplest, but Miller adds that books do far more than preserve ideas. They make ideas more expressive by reaching people that writers could never hope to by word of mouth alone. They increase an idea‚Äôs specificity, developing it from a hunch to a concept to a full-on theory. And they do this over a period of time extending well beyond the original writer‚Äôs natural life. As an example, Miller points to Charles Darwin‚Äôs On the Origin of Species . While sailing with the HMS Beagle , Darwin‚Äôs idea of evolution by natural selection was a hunch ‚Äî an impressive hunch, but more intuition than idea. As he developed his thinking in his journals and letters to trusted colleagues, the idea became more expressive and specific. He then took the next step to write On the Origin , which sharpened the idea further and ensured it would be available for others to use long after Darwin‚Äôs passing. And that‚Äôs exactly what happened. In the century and a half since its initial publication, the theory of evolution by natural selection has been refined by other thinkers, often by connecting it to ideas they found in other books. The big one is the laws of Mendelian inheritance, which provide a keystone for evolutionary theory today ‚Äî and would have saved poor Darwin a heap of trouble had he known about Mendel‚Äôs work. Repeat a similar process across countless readers, cultures, and eras, and the software of books has expanded and multiplied our ideas exponentially, helping to elevate ‚Äúthe human mind beyond its natural limits.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo human mind can compass the amount of information we produce in a year, let alone what we‚Äôve accreted over, say, 3,500 years of civilization,‚Äù Miller says.

For instance, Charles Lyell‚Äôs Principles of Geology proposed that the Earth was far older than previously imagined, a crucial idea in evolutionary theory.

Clay tablets sporting cuneiform are better than nothing, but they have certain disadvantages. They‚Äôre bulky, heavy, and scraping your nail across one will make your soul shudder. They are also cumbersome to sort and store. Just imagine, Miller says, a book the size of Middlemarch written on clay tablets. Papyrus scrolls offset some of these problems: They are easier to produce and store, and papyrus is a far more flexible surface to write on. But they have their own drawbacks. For one, if you want to return to a particular passage later on, you can‚Äôt just open the bookmarked page. You have to unfurl the entire scroll up to the passage, and some scrolls could measure more than 100 feet long . They also contained less text than modern books and were typically written in scriptio continua , a writing system in which words run together without punctuation and must be parsed syllabically. Scholars have variously referred to the result of this system as ‚Äúa river of letters‚Äù or ‚Äúa monolith of characters,‚Äù but to my eyes, it looks more like a cryptograph found on the back of a cereal box. However you want to describe it, scriptio continua and the scrolls‚Äô other difficulties made reading laborious. So laborious, Miller tells me, that few Greco-Romans had the time or privilege to learn, and even those elites would typically buy slaves to organize their libraries and read texts to them. ‚ÄúReading was an attainment of a certain type of person, and reading was never intended to be broadly applied,‚Äù Miller says. ‚ÄúLiteracy in the Roman world would have been relatively high, [but] maybe only 5% of the people could read a public pronouncement or graffiti on a wall with a sort of workman‚Äôs literacy. The ability to read a philosophical text or decipher a poem [belonged to] a relatively tiny fragment of the population. And, by the way, that‚Äôs how they wanted it.‚Äù The shift to the codex solved some of these problems. They are easier to store, can contain more text, and make passages easier to relocate. But it was paper and the printing press that gave the software its most important version update. In his book, Miller cites scholarly estimates that between the 6th and 14th centuries, Western Europe produced roughly 6 million books, or 7,000 ‚Äúand change‚Äù per year on average. In the 150 years after Gutenberg‚Äôs printing press, the number skyrocketed to 212 million, with some estimates placing it even higher. But the often unsung hero of this history is paper, which Miller says ‚Äúsolved the problem of scale‚Äù in a big way. No human mind can compass the amount of information we produce in a year, let alone what we‚Äôve accreted over, say, 3,500 years of civilization Joel Miller Parchment production is labor-intensive and time-consuming; it takes a lot of skinned animals to produce enough for one book. An 8th-century Latin translation of the Bible, called the Codex Amiatinus , required as many as 500 sheep to be slaughtered for its pages. While papyrus doesn‚Äôt require literal sacrificial lambs, it isn‚Äôt as durable as paper, and it is made from a single plant found mainly in Egypt. One bad harvest, and you‚Äôre out of luck. Conversely, you can make reams of durable, sturdy paper relatively quickly and cheaply from the various fiber plant materials you can turn into pulp. ‚ÄúIf you look at every subsequent development in intellectual history in the West that depends on books, which is basically all of them, paper helped make that possible,‚Äù Miller says. Consider science. Before paper and the printing press, it took a long time for scribes to make new copies of books. If a text was lost, damaged, or recycled for reuse in another book, it could take months to a year to produce another one ‚Äî assuming it wasn‚Äôt the only copy available. Even if a copy existed and would-be scientists knew where it was, they may not be able to readily access it due to travel or other restrictions. After the advent of paper, most scientists could own a personal copy of a particular treatise or monograph, and the copies would be nearly identical in content. Scientists working on the same problem could share information and solutions through books and letters more quickly, which proliferated the number of ideas available to work with. This abundance also allowed them to more easily check each other‚Äôs work and offer solutions or counterproposals. ‚ÄúAll of a sudden, science explodes in the West in a way it hadn‚Äôt before,‚Äù Miller says. ‚ÄúInstead of there being this mass scarcity of information ‚Äî this scarcity to the software inside books ‚Äî all the ideas, tools, and concepts conveyed in these books can be used to do more innovative work and push theories in all sorts of different directions simultaneously because you have lots of people working at the same time on similar problems.‚Äù Cuneiform tablets from the Library of Ashurbanipal (circa 1500-539 BC) are housed at the British Museum in London. ( Credit : Wikimedia Commons) In search of a search engine We just crammed far too many centuries into too few paragraphs, but this short history does hint at one of Miller‚Äôs themes in his book. As he put it, ‚ÄúThe reality is that the book turned out to be so ridiculously useful that society adopted it. That‚Äôs how technological advancement always works.‚Äù Another tradition is that new technology will have its opponents and naysayers, and while that may be difficult for us to imagine on this side of the literary revolution, it was true for the book as well. Socrates famously had misgivings about written philosophy ; he worried that the medium weakens memory, leads to superficial understanding, and cannot accommodate new ideas or questions (as a dialogue partner can). ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always a group of people that oppose [technological advancement] because they‚Äôre not clear on the trade-off,‚Äù Miller says. ‚ÄúThey understand what they‚Äôre losing, but not what they‚Äôre gaining. Or worse, there‚Äôs a kind of narcissism ‚Äî they don‚Äôt care or think about what other people may gain.‚Äù Toward the end of our conversation, I asked Miller what his study of the history of books taught him about the technological shifts in our own time, specifically the information overload online and burgeoning AI scene. Looking back, Miller points out that information overload has been with us for quite some time. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs deeply entrenched in the history of the book,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúknowing that there is simply too much to know and constantly coming up with schemes, techniques, and methods to corral all the information. Humans are dang good at creating information, and we don‚Äôt think about the costs of creating information because we have so much to gain from it.‚Äù For instance, the Royal Library of Ashurbanipal , named for the Neo-Assyrian king who amassed the collection in the 7th century B.C., housed tens of thousands of clay tablets. These contained information on laws, omens, rituals, annals, treaties, medicine, and magic, and with little more than waxen tablets , archivists had to devise a system to keep track of it all. If the Royal Library was ‚Äúan internet of clay and sandal leather,‚Äù then this metadata system was its search engine. The same is true for the Library of Alexandria, where librarians tagged scrolls, stored similar subjects together, and maintained vast catalogs. Some readers may even remember thumbing through card catalog cabinets in their elementary school libraries to find books using the Dewey Decimal System . All evolutionary stages of the search engine before it went digital. ‚Äú[The economist] Tyler Cowen made a comment in his book Stubborn Attachments that once an idea has been generated, it can be used at zero marginal costs by everyone else, but that‚Äôs only true if you can find it,‚Äù Miller says. ‚ÄúGregor Mendel‚Äôs work was lost for decades until somebody ran across it and decided it was useful.‚Äù One hope Miller has for generative AI is that large language models (LLMs) will help us grapple with this age-old problem more effectively. While the internet allows us to share and discover ideas more quickly than ever ‚Äî no more schlepping to the nearest monastery ‚Äî it has also exponentially increased how much information we have to sift through to find the ideas we need. Digital search engines try to wrangle all that data, but they still leave us a lot to sift through, and their ranking systems can be manipulated. Miller argues that LLMs have the potential to perform this task more efficiently. They could filter through unfathomable amounts of data to find the ideas users need ‚Äî helping us to better connect our ideas and make the software of books even more powerful. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an underappreciated reason for LLMs,‚Äù Miller says. ‚ÄúThey aren‚Äôt just for cheating on your history finals.‚Äù Many paintings of Augustine of Hippo, such as this one by Philippe de Champaigne (circa 1645), depict the saint writing or reading a book. ( Credit : Wikimedia Commons) In the book of memory But let‚Äôs not forget those trade-offs. Socrates may have missed the mark on books, but as Miller points out, he wasn‚Äôt entirely wrong about them either. We do ‚Äúoutsource some of our memory to the page,‚Äù a trend that has only deepened with smartphones. They can also be one-sided. If we‚Äôre not careful to read widely on a particular subject, we can trick ourselves into believing we have a firmer grasp on it than we actually do. When considering LLMs, Miller warns we must be mindful of similar trade-offs. He worries that we risk abdicating our critical thinking skills if we come to rely on AIs to assess arguments or solve every problem. We may also come to trust these machines to the point that we no longer check the accuracy of the answers they provide. ‚ÄúIf we de-skill that part of ourselves, we will have lost something essential actually functioning in a society,‚Äù Miller says. And while our conversation focused on books as an informational technology, Miller stresses that they are an experiential technology, too. Through literature, we vicariously embody the emotional lives of others. We see the world through their eyes, feel the crushing force of their defeats, and partake in their joys. Books provide people a means to share their common humanity ‚Äî something that, for all their parroting, LLMs simply can‚Äôt do. ‚ÄúAn LLM can‚Äôt atomize human experience and present it back to us in a way that‚Äôs compelling,‚Äù Miller says. ‚ÄúA novelist can create an immersive experience that is emotionally, psychologically, intellectually, and morally rich. That cannot be duplicated by an LLM at this point, and maybe never, because an LLM has no human experience to draw on. All it has is the artifacts of those experiences.‚Äù It‚Äôs another facet of the book‚Äôs power inherent in Saint Augustine‚Äôs story. While The Confessions is ultimately a treatise on theology and philosophy, it is also his story. Through it, readers experience his licentious youth, his regrets, and his search for the truth. They come to know his triumphs and losses and struggles. Augustine made full use of the technology of the book to share with others the breadth of his mind and soul. And in doing so, he has continued to inspire us for centuries. ‚ÄúWho knows how [technology] is going to develop, but an LLM cannot be a human, and it cannot do the work that only a human can do,‚Äù Miller adds. ‚ÄúThat privileges the book in a way that we might underappreciate right now. At the same time, it gives us a place to hope about how our interactions with the book may develop in the coming years.‚Äù This article The most successful information technology in history is the one we barely notice is featured on Big Think .","title":"The most successful information technology in history is the one we barely not†}           p¥ãΩ}qÜ=EÚŒ=*ŒF=≤LÎª®(=q˚ºœ⁄Ãº∆¿=ª≠<éùgªñ_.=¿1´Ω0∂î<Î¬Ωü=äÏ∂Ω~›±=oØ.Ωn¿¢<fö4ΩçÒHºX@=Òùº·vˇΩ\¥Ω˛Gº_F¿<<XΩñAΩ4$Ω•ìΩ¶¢ë=QÎí<ªæBú =≥€•<S[.<PÕ<√≈∞ªB†Î;m?<˚[Ω]çwΩ28,ª¯Úº§˜›;–+–∫{/XºÍA¥Ω:„ºß¢ì=Ê3ƒΩﬁ¸Âª%WºI{=qŒ=ÄêÕ=∫œŸº„¿&=Te/=tîJ<zãØ;»e∆<@ªºö+ãº‡Â/<Î)<°ÌΩ-l”=ëƒ<ê¿]Ω[[í<øoﬁª…PªΩjw=jU◊<üêî<ﬁ≥•<ﬁ^é<≈œ;¿&;i^$=–èH<`†UΩ¥64Ω„úÖº\ÙYΩö*5=Tàµ=eL∫∞fΩü~=	¶iºˇΩ⁄ß,=”g,Ω&—/<’¢ºS“=Ûﬁ<\‡£=f≥aΩ ÌΩÊä==PDºÏ£Ω:M)Ωú‘Ûº	N<Ù÷íΩ<	'ΩÁeWΩ÷‘<.[ù=@…©<Ì0€º~^ìΩ¨	∞=ZEÖΩ≥§<á;ΩH3Ã<‘™F=Ò£<MPöΩê~Ωd¯	wH¨=ëX<Kπëº«•`Ω™ºâa≥=⁄∞ºj«ºç"'=7?s<%}p<ﬁtå=≤“.=–;9¥ΩI]ì=ÒíΩ˙ô<=¿˛9ª‘<~ôÄº†àA:±V'ºt#ã<ÌÏ

The anxiety created from damaging an important relationship leads chimpanzees to groom, bonobos to engage in sex, and dogs to show submissiveness. These reconciliatory actions are species-specific strategies to repair and return valuable relationships to their former state. So, what about humans ‚Äî how do we repair our important relationships? The single most important mechanism that we use to earn reconciliation with someone we have harmed is the apology. In his classic book On Apology , Aaron Lazare points to two main reasons why people apologize: ‚ÄúThe first reason is their response to shame, guilt, and empathic regard for those they have offended. The second reason is their attempt to restore the relationship and to avoid further damage to the relationship, abandonment, retaliation, or other punishments.‚Äù To my mind, these two ‚Äúreasons‚Äù essentially amount to the same thing ‚Äî the attempt to restore the relationship is the response to the emotions that come from harming the relationship. The goal of an apology is forgiveness from the person who has been harmed. Lazare goes on to articulate the components of an effective apology ‚Äî one that has the greatest chance of achieving forgiveness from the offended party. The first component is the acknowledgment of the offense and taking responsibility for it. It is important for the offender to own up to their role in causing offense and to recognize that they caused harm to the other. It is not good enough to offer a vague or conditional ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry that you‚Äôre upset,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for whatever I may have done,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry if I hurt you.‚Äù A second component is to explain why one acted as one did. The explanation is linked to taking responsibility, but goes further by recognizing that the person who was offended may need to understand why the offense was caused. The third component is to express remorse with a commitment not to repeat the harmful behavior. Finally, the fourth component is to offer some form of reparation in the apology. Lazare argues that apologies that incorporate these four components provide the greatest likelihood of eliciting forgiveness. And indeed, psychological research has confirmed that effective apologies are among the best ways to achieve forgiveness. Guilt is beautifully designed for this kind of effective apology because of the cocktail of emotions it includes. Imagine a case of gossiping. The guilt you would probably feel after gossiping is a combination of anxiety over possible relationship damage, empathic sadness, or compassion for your friend‚Äôs suffering, and remorse (including a dose of self-directed anger) for your role as the perpetrator of your friend‚Äôs suffering. Each of these three emotional components is involved in constructing an effective apology. Anxiety is the component of guilt that is shared across all of the animal examples we have considered, and it is the main spur for you to act on your guilt. Anxiety is a form of fear, but it is more a reaction to an imagined threat than a present threat. We usually say we are anxious when we fear that something might happen. Fear is sometimes termed the ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù emotion, in the sense that we respond to fear either by challenging the fearful stimulus or by fleeing from it. This contrast applies to the way the anxiety inherent in guilt guides us in the management of our relationships. If you value the relationship that you have harmed, then the anxiety that you feel about the threat to your relationship will motivate you to fight to salvage and heal the relationship. But sometimes our anxiety over the way we have harmed a relationship may lead to more of a flight response, whereby we retreat from the relationship. The single most important mechanism that we use to earn reconciliation with someone we have harmed is the apology. In addition to anxiety, guilt involves compassion for your friend‚Äôs distress, and self-directed anger or self-blame for what you did, what I call ‚Äúremorse.‚Äù Compassion involves understanding and caring about your friend‚Äôs suffering. When your friend is suffering, you want to acknowledge it and try to provide comfort. How you alleviate that distress, of course, must recognize your role in causing that distress. Certainly, it would not be good enough to simply send your friend a bottle of wine to cheer them up and then expect forgiveness. Your remorse for being the cause of your friend‚Äôs distress is what enables you to accept reprobation and punishment for what you did. Your friend and perhaps others whom you care about may judge you harshly, but you also recognize and accept that you were disloyal and that you deserve their blame. You might also accept that you deserve to suffer in some way as a form of atonement. Admitting your responsibility in this way is critical to an honest reconciliation of your relationship. Together, compassion and remorse lead to regret ‚Äî you wish you had never tried to impress your new acquaintance by gossiping about your friend. Clearly, you cannot go back in time and undo what you did, but you can express sorrow for what you did and resolve not to do it again. This regret also needs to be conveyed to your friend so they can have confidence in your future loyalty. This combination of responses is most likely to yield forgiveness from the other.
